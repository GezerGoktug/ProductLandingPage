# ProductLandingPage
**<p>In this project, I designed a simple product landing page. In this project, a fixed navbar was designed at the top using css flex and position:fixed property. In the rest of the site, css properties such as flex, flex-direction, grid were used. It was designed to be mobile compatible.</p>**
